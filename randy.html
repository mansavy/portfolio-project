        Who’d have thought pierogies could lead to the creation of one of
        Canada’s greatest anthems?
      </p>

      <p>
        It happened when Randy Bachman (whose mother is Ukrainian) got up on
        stage in Vancouver in the early 70s. He was performing with
        Bachman–Turner Overdrive (BTO) and had a lot to prove since leaving The
        Guess Who in 1970. So when BTO’s singer, Fred Turner, whispered to
        Bachman that he had lost his voice and couldn’t perform, just moments
        before the set, Bachman had to take over vocal duties. But he didn’t
        know what to sing.
      </p>

      <p>
        He played Santana’s “Oye Como Va” for the crowd but, not speaking
        Spanish, he did not know the lyrics. Figuring the audience didn’t know
        Spanish either, Bachman threw in a couple of his own words.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oye Como Va…pierogies!” laughs Bachman at the Calgary stop on his Vinyl
        Tap Tour, which is inspired by his CBC radio show of the same name.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the concert (and in his book Vinyl Tap Stories), the affable
        frontman shares tales of his guitars, his childhood in Winnipeg and how
        some of the most recognizable songs in Canada’s—if not the
        world’s—history were born.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bachman is joined onstage by three musicians who back him while playing
        snippets of classic Guess Who songs like, “American Woman,” “These
        Eyes,” BTO’s “You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet” and “Takin’ Care of Business.”
      </p>

      <p>
        And that last song, Bachman tells his Calgary audience, is the one with
        the pierogi connection.
      </p>

      <p>
        After playing his unique interpretation of “Oye Como Va” for 20 minutes
        in that Vancouver show over 40 years ago, Bachman needed something else
        to play. He pieced together two songs he had been working on and, in
        front of the live audience, a hit was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You get up every morning, from your alarm clock’s warning, take the
        8:15 into the city…” sings Bachman in Calgary before he and the crowd
        erupt into the chorus.
      </p>
      <p>“Takin’ care of business, every day!”</p>
      <p>And he certainly did.</p>
