    <div class="story">
      <p>
        One of the oldest cities in the United States, Boston features
        attractive architecture and many offbeat attractions. We visit three of
        the city’s most interesting and engaging neighbourhoods and then cross
        the river to explore Greater Boston’s city of Cambridge.
      </p>

      <h3>North End</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Boston’s oldest residential area is just one square kilometre in size,
        but it’s filled with Italian restaurants, old-world food markets, wine
        shops and 18th- and 19th-century churches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built in 1723, Old North Church is Boston’s oldest surviving church
        building. On a 30-minute tour, peek inside the bell-ringing chamber, and
        learn about what happened on the night of April 18, 1775, when Patriots
        (colonial rebels) lit lanterns to warn the city that the British were
        coming and sparked the American Revolutionary War. On your own, walk
        among the box pews in the nave and wrap up your visit in the cramped
        underground crypts, where you’ll find 37 colonial-era tombs.
      </p>
      <p>
        For another celestial treat, take a short stroll east to Battery
        Street’s All Saints Way, where area resident Peter Baldassari’s
        collection of Catholic saint prayer cards and statues covers a small
        alley. The installation towers up six metres with tributes to St.
        Joseph, St. Jude and Mother Teresa, one of the shrine’s latest
        additions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back on Salem Street, pop into some shops. Polcari’s Coffee is an
        85-year-old Italian spice, tea and coffee store, while the Salmagundi
        hats and accessories shop stocks more than 4,000 hats. Walk one block to
        Hanover Street’s Parla, a contemporary Italian eatery. Accompany
        arancini rice balls or lobster ravioli with an off-the-menu cocktail.
        Toss dice from a julep cup to select one of 20 special, off-menu drinks.
        The higher the roll, the more adventurous the drink.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few doors down, Improv Asylum’s basement theatre presents a 90-minute
        evening show. The six-comedian house troupe performs sketches, musical
        numbers and improv in the round, tackling politics, celebrity culture
        and life in “Bahston.”
      </p>

            <h3>Downtown</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Encompassing 34 blocks, downtown Boston features the city’s top
              attractions, including historic Faneuil Hall. Visit its shops and
              a small military museum featuring weapons and uniforms from the
              American Revolution. Also pop in to the white-columned, second-
              and third-floor Great Hall, the site of symposiums by founding
              father Samuel Adams. Outside, view the gilded grasshopper
              weathervane, atop the building, that has survived earthquakes,
              fires and snowstorms to remain one of the building’s only original
              1742 features.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nearby in McKinley Square, admire the 1837 Greek-revival rotunda
              at Marriott Vacation Club Pulse at Custom House, Boston with its
              grand cupola and artifacts that include seafaring navigational
              tools. At 2 p.m., for a small fee and weather permitting, take the
              elevator up the clock tower to the 26th-floor observation deck for
              a 360-degree view of Boston that encompasses the harbour and Long
              Wharf, which resembles a ship.

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Head to the Granary Burying Ground where you’ll find 17th-century
        tombstones and, just outside, one of the country’s oldest independent
        libraries, which contains almost 500,000 books (including a memoir bound
        in the writer’s own skin). Embark on a free, hour-long tour of the
        19th-century, Neo-Palladian-style Boston Athenæum to view its private
        libraries, spiral staircases and reading rooms once frequented by
        Nathaniel Hawthorne, Louisa May Alcott and Ralph Waldo Emerson.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walk five minutes south and slip behind a hidden door in a hair salon to
        Yvonne’s, a supper club situated in a cellar built in 1832. In its
        handsome library bar with gilded fireplace, you’ll find funky portraits,
        including Bill Murray in military uniform. Feast on stone-fired pita
        topped with Turkish beef sausage, mozzarella and basil marrow butter, as
        well as onion and parsley salad.
      </p>

      <h3>Fenway-Kenmore</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        This sprawling area is home to the oldest Major League Baseball park.
        For intimate Red Sox action, visit Bleacher Bar underneath Fenway Park’s
        centre-field bleachers. Grab a seat by the garage door-sized window for
        a ground-level view of the game for the cost of a Harpoon IPA or a warm
        pastrami sandwich. On non-game days, head down the street to Blazing
        Paddles pub and book time to swing away at the official Fenway Park
        visitors’ batting cage.
      </p>
      <p>
        On your way to Boston University’s Mugar Memorial Library, cut through
        Kenmore Square to see the towering CITGO sign with its distinctive red
        triangle. At the university’s library, the Howard Gotlieb Archival
        Research Center displays documents and memorabilia from 20th- and
        21st-century musicians, actors, writers and more. Admire a caseful of
        Emmys (Dan Rather), Oscars (Gene Kelly) and Tony Awards, a film script
        that Bette Davis used to learn her lines, an Edison wax cylinder
        phonograph and a room dedicated to alum Martin Luther King Jr.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, head south to the Isabella Stuart Gardner Museum, where the
        American heiress once occupied the top floor of this palatial,
        four-storey building. Displays include around 6,500 objects like
        paintings, furniture and sculptures in Gardner’s own idiosyncratic
        layout. Start exploring in the Venetian courtyard, then check out the
        Titian room, in which everything from the Persian carpet to the Italian
        glassware complements Europa, an original Renaissance masterpiece
        painting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Walk to 6 Clearway Street, where Bodega, Boston’s hippest sneaker
        boutique, hides behind a secret door in a nameless convenience store.
        Its wood-panel shelving holds shoes from Converse and rare Adidas to
        US$645 Yeezy boots. Also find curated streetwear by brands like Raised
        by Wolves.

              <br />
              Across the Charles River from Boston, the 18-square-kilometre city
              of Cambridge is a hub of innovation fed not only by Harvard
              University but also by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
              (MIT). Spend the day exploring the campus to see the world’s
              largest holography collection at the MIT Museum, the whimsically
              accordioned facets of the Frank Gehry-designed Ray and Maria Stata
              Center for Computer Information and Intelligence Sciences and a
              performance by the world’s oldest continuously operating juggling
              group. Here, you’ll also find a mural on the floor of the Green
              Center for Physics consisting of squares filled with multicoloured
              geometric shapes that seem to change dimension, depending on your
              point of view.

      <br />
      <p>
        On Broadway, take the elevator at Cambridge Center to its secret rooftop
        garden to view Boston’s skyline and then stop at Broad Institute’s
        DNAtrium on Main Street to check out free, interactive displays
        detailing biomedical discoveries. Continue on to Miracle of Science Bar
        + Grill on Massachusetts Avenue and order off the periodic table menu.
        Try Rb (a burger topped with jalapenos and pepper jack cheese) or B2
        (two beef skewers with apricot chutney) with a Downeast Cider, then duck
        into a brick alcove dubbed Graffiti Alley to admire street art that
        glistens under a multicoloured glass canopy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Walk another 15 minutes down Massachusetts to reach Boston Burger
        Company for a rich dessert. Order from its Freak Frappe menu for a boozy
        milkshake masterpiece that may incorporate a candy rim, deep-fried
        bananas, toasted marshmallows or an entire slice of strawberry
        shortcake.
      </p>
      <p>
        For yet more art appreciation, take the subway from Harvard to Davis
        station to visit Somerville Theatre where you’ll find strange paintings
        at The Museum of Bad Art.
