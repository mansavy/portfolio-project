      <p>
        Situated in the Emerald Isle’s northeast—just a two-hour drive from
        Dublin—Belfast is transforming itself into a must-visit destination.
        Recent multi-million-pound renovations to its city centre, called the
        Cathedral Quarter, have filled the restored Victorian buildings with
        Michelin-starred restaurants, pubs and shops. Size-wise, the capital of
        Northern Ireland may be small, but it’s crammed with fun—or, as the
        locals say, craic.
      </p>

      <h3>Day 1</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Morning: Start your day by exploring the Titanic Quarter, a former
        dockyard famous as the birthplace of the ill-fated ocean liner. The area
        is undergoing a revitalization with the addition of shops, restaurants
        and parks, and is home to Titanic Belfast, a museum featuring replicas
        of passenger suites. Afternoon: Cross the River Lagan pedestrian bridge
        to the Cathedral Quarter for lunch at Taylor & Clay. This cozy spot is
        known for wood-fire-grilled dishes such as Himalayan salt-aged ribeye.
        After lunch, take a stroll through the area’s streets—amongst the oldest
        in the city—to see pubs and shops covered in museum-worthy street art
        and architectural gems, like the Victorian-era Customs House. Evening:
        Down the street, snag a table at the Michelin-starred OX to indulge in
        the five-course tasting menu. The menu changes frequently to make use of
        seasonal produce, but past dishes have included lobster with peas,
        radishes and pickled mussels, and chateaubriand steak with bone marrow,
        chard and horseradish.

            <h3>Day 2</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Morning: Take McComb’s Coach Travel’s full-day Game of Thrones bus
              tour. Not just for fans of the HBO series, the tour follows the
              Causeway Coastal Route—one of the prettiest drives in the world—to
              filming sites like the Cushendun Caves and Ballintoy Harbour, a
              tiny fishing village with picturesque limestone bricks jutting
              into the North Atlantic Ocean. Afternoon: The tour stops for pub
              grub—like bangers and mash—at Fullerton Arms in Ballintoy and then
              continues to the ocean-spanning Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge and
              Giant’s Causeway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site where the shore is
              covered in ancient hexagonal basalt columns (created by the rapid
              cooling of lava millions of years ago). The next stop is the
              Instagram-worthy Dark Hedges, a road lined with beech trees
              curving into a scenic tunnel. Evening: The tour ends back in
              Belfast, near the ornate 1820s Crown Liquor Saloon. Grab a seat in
              one of its carved-mahogany booths and wash down the Irish lamb
              stew with Bushmills Whiskey (distilled nearby). Finish the night
              by catching a musical performance at the nearby 150-year-old
              Ulster Hall.

      <h3>Day 3</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Morning: Let guide Billy Scott whisk you around in his black cab to some
        of Belfast’s historic sites, including the Crumlin Road Gaol (a storied
        prison), the Stormont Parliament Buildings and Belfast Castle. You’ll
        also stop at the peace walls: barbedwire-topped barriers towering
        several metres high and covered in political murals. The walls, built in
        the late 1960s during a period in Northern Irish history known as the
        Troubles, still separate neighbourhoods today. Afternoon: End your black
        cab tour with a classic lunch of beer-battered fish and chips at The
        Barking Dog, located in the southern Queen’s Quarter. Afterwards, walk
        to the free Ulster Museum to see its 77-metre-long, medieval-inspired
        Game of Thrones tapestry and Neolithic stone axes. Evening: Back in the
        Cathedral Quarter, dine at The Muddlers Club. This restaurant serves
        seasonal dishes like mackerel with dill and apple, and a banana, caramel
        and rum dessert. Before heading back to your room, cross the street to
        the Dirty Onion Pub for free bodhrán (Irish drum) lessons and a
        well-deserved Guinness.
