      <p>
        Before MTV debuted in 1981, music videos consisted of performance clips
        by British bands who couldn’t afford to tour America. But when the
        station took off, everything about videos got bigger: the concepts, the
        budgets, the stunts—and definitely the hair. But making videos wasn’t
        all glamour. Behind the scenes, the long days were filled with vomit,
        blood, and diarrhea. Here’s a brief look at the injuries and ailments
        behind some of the decade’s most iconic videos.

      <h3 class="text-center">Adam & the Ants - "Stand and Deliver"</h3>
      <br />

      <iframe
        width="560"
        class="video"
        height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4B2a6l6wM2k"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
      ></iframe>

      <br />
      <p>
        Adam Ant performed his own stunts in “Stand and Deliver.” He had already
        jumped out of a tree but when it came time for the dandy highwayman to
        jump through a breakaway glass window, he balked. The crew insisted it
        wouldn’t hurt—but, in fact, it hurt a great deal when he split his head
        open and bled everywhere. Adam was able to finish what is probably his
        best-known video, but he learned his lesson. Months later, he hired a
        stuntman for “Ant Rap,” who also injured himself onset.

      <h3 class="text-center">Prince - "1999"</h3>
      <br />
      <iframe
        width="560"
        height="315"
        class="video"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rblt2EtFfC4"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
      ></iframe>
      <br />
      <p>
        Prince’s 1982 single “1999” is a bit of a bummer (it’s about the nuclear
        arms race). But for the video Prince wanted something more fun—namely
        purple lights and tons of smoke. The shoot only took four hours, but
        that was enough time for it to have a negative effect on the crew: The
        mineral oil used in the smoke machine made everyone have diarrhea.

      <h3 class="text-center">The Police - "Wrapped Around Your Finder"</h3>
      <br />
      <iframe
        width="560"
        height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/svWINSRhQU0"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        class="video"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
      ></iframe>
      <br />
      <p>
        With next to no money or concept, The Police shot “Wrapped Around your
        Finger” on a set consisting of 1000 candles. For the last shot,
        directors Godley & Creme asked everyone to leave the set except Sting
        and two crewmembers. Their only direction was to film whatever Sting
        did. Mephistopheles may not have been his name, but when Sting knocked
        over the candles, the hot wax burned him and the two other men.
        Thankfully, the burns weren’t severe.

      <h3 class="text-center">Van Halen - "Panama"</h3>
      <br />
      <iframe
        width="560"
        height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fuKDBPw8wQA"
        class="video"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
      ></iframe
      ><br />
      <p>
        The “Panama” video consisted of Van Halen flying across the stage
        through the air and generally just acting nuts. And that’s exactly what
        got bassist Michael Anthony injured. Anthony was the first to shoot his
        flying scene, but the harness didn’t quite fit. He likened the
        experience to being castrated and having his nuts in a vise. Anthony
        recovered from the incident and went on to father two children after the
        making of this video. And “Panama” went on to become one of the most
        famous cock rock songs of all time.

      <h3 class="text-center">Billy Idol - "Eyes Without a Face"</h3>
      <br />
      <iframe
        width="560"
        height="315"
        class="video"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9OFpfTd0EIs"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
      ></iframe
      ><br />
      <p>
        For 30 straight hours, Billy Idol didn’t see anything but fire, smoke,
        and half-naked women while making “Eyes Without a Face.” And those were
        almost the last things he ever saw. The day after the shoot, Idol was
        hospitalized when his contact lenses fused to his eyes thanks to the dry
        ice on set and lack of sleep. Months later, on the “Flesh for Fantasy”
        shoot, the cinematographer and director both went blind from exhaustion.
        Luckily, everyone’s sight returned and the two videos helped Rebel Yell
        last 70 weeks on the Billboard charts.

      <h3 class="text-center">Culture Club - "The War Song"</h3>
      <br />
      <iframe
        width="560"
        height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBd5W9IA7n0"
        class="video"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
      ></iframe
      ><br />
      <p>
        Around 400 kids appeared in this anti-war video, and Culture Club made
        an effort to take great care of them. Everything was going great until
        after lunch; the kids ate burgers, fries, and milkshakes, and when
        crewmembers suspended some of the kids in the air for a parachute scene,
        they were promptly puked on.

      <h3 class="text-center">Duran Duran - "The Wild Boys"</h3>
      <br />
      <iframe
        width="560"
        height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M43wsiNBwmo"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        class="video"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
      ></iframe
      ><br />
      <p>
        Duran Duran wrote “The Wild Boys” for a movie of the same name. When it
        fell through, director Russell Mulcahy channeled his ideas into this
        epic $1 million post-apocalyptic video. The second verse consisted of
        singer Simon Le Bon strapped to a windmill that dipped his head below
        water. When the windmill broke with Le Bon’s head underwater, the crew
        had to rescue him from drowning. Le Bon downplayed the incident, saying
        he didn’t fear for his life. Maybe that’s because he also survived a
        near shark attack while shooting “Rio.”
